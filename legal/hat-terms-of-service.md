## 2. About HAT Microservers

2.1. A &quot; HAT Microserver&quot; is a personal software device that can be used to collect, store and ultimately control your data (as a HAT &quot; Owner&quot;). It consists of a database wrapped with pieces of software code. In using your HAT Microserver, you execute the pieces of soft-ware code that are sets of permissions and instructions (&quot;the permissions&quot;) that would enable you to permit or instruct the collection of your data from multiple sources into your HAT Microserver database; and enable the transformation and the transfer of the data from within your HAT Microserver database. You can also use the permissions to enable the use of HATDeX Platform Services so that you can view and easily manage your HAT. Finally, you can also use a HAT Microserver as a type of universal user account and use the permissions to control the data going to other applications and services that are HAT enabled.

2.2. When operating your HAT Microserver you interact with the HATDeX Platform. In doing so, you must comply with the HAT Acceptable Use Policy ( [https://hatdex.org/hat-acceptable-use-policy](https://hatdex.org/hat-acceptable-use-policy) ). HATDeX has no access to your data and are not responsible for its contents, organisation, visibility and usage. HATDeX services (such as the HAT app) may facilitate the convenient execution of your permissions.

2.3 SECURITY &amp; USAGE OF YOUR HAT MICROSERVER

Data in your HAT Microserver database is your data (&quot; Your Data&quot;). You agree to provide accurate, current and complete registration data and to update Your HATDeX Account Data as required in order to keep it accurate, current and complete.

2.3.2. We are a data controller and data processor for purposes of data protection law for Your HATDeX Account Data.
