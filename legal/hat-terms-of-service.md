1.3 OUR REGULATORS

1.3.1         We are regulated by the HAT community Foundation as a &quot;HAT Platform Provider&quot;, a certified technology provider for the provisioning, issuance and vending of HAT Microservers, for the platform of data exchange between HAT Microservers and HAT-enabled applications and for the conduct of the HAT ecosystem.

1.3.2         We are regulated by the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office under registration number ZA244725 as our lead data protection authority globally for HATDeX Account data used to create HAT Microservers which is the only personal data that HATDeX holds.

## 2. About HAT Microservers

2.1. DEFINITION. A &quot;HAT Microserver&quot; is a personal software device that can be used to collect, store and ultimately control your data (as a HAT &quot;Owner&quot;). It consists of a single dedicated database wrapped with pieces of software code (Microservices). In using your HAT Microserver, you execute the pieces of software code that are sets of permissions and executions (collectively known as &quot;the HMIs&quot;) that would enable you to use your microserver as a universal data profile to be used with applications and services that are HAT enabled.

2.2 DEFINITION. HAT Microserver Instructions (HMI) is a set of instructions given by a HAT owner to his/her HAT at the request of a HAT-enabled application. HAT Microserver Instructions (&quot;HMI&quot;) are instructions to your HAT Microserver that:

2.1.1 permit the collection of your data from multiple Internet sources into your HAT Microserver database (&quot;GET&quot; permission)

2.1.2 permit the processing and transformation of data within your HAT Microserver (&quot;PROCESS&quot; permission)

2.1.3 permit the transfer of the data from within your HAT Microserver (&quot;GIVE&quot; permission)

2.1.4 permit the viewing of your HAT Microserver data (&quot;READ&quot; permission).

2.1.5 permit data to be written into your HAT Microserver data (&quot;WRITE&quot; permission).

2.1.6 Execute your Microserver code to create data debits

2.1.7 Execute your Microserver code to manage applications

2.1.8 Execute your Microserver code to manage your data and files

2.2. DEFINITION. &quot;HAT issuers and vendors&quot; are organisations that are able to issue a HAT Microserver, or vend a HAT Microserver (i.e. point to a link where a HAT Microserver can be acquired). In issuing or vending HATs, HAT issuers and vendors abide by the terms of this agreement.

2.3. When operating your HAT Microserver you interact with the HATDeX Platform. In doing so, you must comply with HATDeX Acceptable Use Policy ( [https://hatdex.org/hat-acceptable-use-policy](https://hatdex.org/hat-acceptable-use-policy) ). HATDeX has no access to your data and are not responsible for its contents, organisation, visibility and usage.

This information that HATDeX collects from you to set up your HAT Microserver is your HATDeX account data (&quot; Your HATDeX Account Data&quot;). Data in your HAT Microserver database is your data (&quot;Your Data&quot;). You agree to provide accurate, current and complete registration data and to update Your HATDeX Account Data as required in order to keep it accurate, current and complete.

2.4.2. We are a data controller and data processor for purposes of data protection law for Your HATDeX Account Data. However, we are neither a data controller nor a data processor for purposes of data protection law for Your Data. We simply enable you to claim, hold, transform and share Your Data by assisting you to easily execute the HMIs in your HAT.

2.4.3. Responsibilities: It is your responsibility to:

2.4.3.1 protect against unauthorised access to your HAT Microserver

2.4.3.5. keep your password or other access information secret (your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access), and

2.4.3.6. generally, maintain good internet security practices.

2.4.4. You will notify HATDeX immediately at support@hatdex.org upon becoming aware of any unauthorised use of any of Your Data or Your HAT Microserver Data or any other breach of security. If you think that your email account has been compromised you should change your HAT Microserver credentials, and in particular make sure your compromised email account does not allow access to your HAT Microserver.

2.5 DATA PLUGS AND APPS ON YOUR HAT MICROSERVER

2.5.1. DEFINITION. A HAT Data Plug (&quot;Data Plug&quot;) is a third-party service that may or may not be part of our Services. Data Plugs are API-to-API services that enable you to transfer your data from a source platform where you generated data e.g. Facebook, to your HAT Microserver.

2.5.2 DEFINITION. HAT-enabled Application (&quot;App&quot;) isa third-party service that may or may not be part of our Services. We make various &quot;apps&quot; available on the HATDeX Platform. Such applications are licensed and not sold to you and your licence to use the application will be dependent on your acceptance of additional terms (including in some instances payment terms) contained in an End User Licence Agreement that you will need to accept before using the application. Apps provide you with a service using a designated namespace in your HAT Microserver as data storage, and also enable you to exchange other HAT data with the App. You enable Data Plugs and Apps to act on your HAT Microserver by way of HMIs.

2.5.2.1. You agree that you will only authorise a Data Plug/App when you are not prohibited under this Owner TOS or any applicable law from obtaining the data concerned. We reserve the right not to execute the instruction or to disable any Data Plug/App for which you have not the right to obtain the data or that is in violation of the Terms of this Agreement or any applicable law.

2.5.2.2. You agree that when you enable a data plug/App, youconfirm theHAT Microserver instructions to be activated under based on the permissions granted and the tasks executed under the HMIs.

2.5.2.3. You can decide to disable a Data Plug/app at any time. The Data Plug will stop transferring the data concerned as soon as you disable the Data Plug and you will have no access to the App if you disable it.

2.5.2.4. You agree that we are not responsible for the accuracy of the data coming into the HAT through these data plugs/apps.

2.5.2.5. In enabling data plugs, you agree that you are requesting real time, portable, subject access from the data plug service provider under data protection regulation, should such a regulation be applicable to HAT owners. In enabling apps, you agree that the data you generate on the app and stored in your HAT Microserver is your data.

2.5.2.6. Data plugs may obtain data from a source platform (e.g. Facebook) where the data is generated. You agree that Data Plug service providers do not guarantee that the data obtained from the source platform is a complete account of data generated by you.

2.5.2.7. You agree that you will not amend any data within aplug or app namespace through any other means except through the data plug/app that is authorised to write into the namespace unless explicitly allowed by the data plug/app service provider to do so.

2.5.2.8. You agree that Data plug/App service providers do not guarantee that the data obtained from the source platform where the data is generated or from within the App is free from conditions of re-use and re-share by the HAT owner

2.5.3 DEFINITION. HAT-enabled tools (&quot;tools&quot;) are codes that transform your data through computations such as analytic functions or algorithmic functions. These tools may or may not be part of our Services. These tools are uploaded into our Smart HAT Engine (SHE) service and do not interact with any other data except your data in the HAT Microserver.

2.5.3.1. You agree that tools that transform your data are allowed to write the data into your HAT Microserver database

## 3. Rules Applicable to HAT Owner Services

3.1. DEFINITION. The &quot;HAT Owner Services&quot; are web or mobile applications that allow the HAT Owner to view the data in their HAT Microserver and easily execute the HMIs within the HAT. Except for performance improvements, Owner Services do not store any HAT personal data. Owner services are also called Z class applications under the HATDeX Rating scheme (  [https://www.hatcommunity.org/hat-dex-rating](https://www.hatcommunity.org/hat-dex-rating)) and they enable the HAT owner to execute HMIs for other HAT enabled applications and services upon instruction of the HAT owner. The right to operate owners services are given only to HAT Platform Providers who are tasked to maintain the privacy, security, ownership rights and instruction models of HATs by the HAT Community Foundation.

3.2. We make available to you various Owner Services, compatible with different computer Operating Systems, to enable you to manage the HMIs within your HAT Microserver. Some of the HAT Owner Services are also made available as an open source programme for others to build on.

3.3. HAT Owner Services extensions are additional software developed by us or third parties that can modify and/or enhance the functionality of the HAT Owner services (the &quot; Extensions&quot;). Extensions may require the collection and processing of your personal and browsing data. You agree that we may, without notice, look for available updates to Extensions, download them and install them automatically. We reserve the right to disable or remove Extensions that do not comply with the Terms of this Agreement or any applicable law.

## 4. Rules Applicable to HAT Microserver Instructions (HMIs)

## 4.1. HMIs will be presented to you for every HAT enabled application that wishes to interact with your HAT Microserver and your confirmation is required before the request is fulfilled. HMIs will be presented to you through a standard interface with the following information:

-
  - the HMI ID and version number for the application requesting it
  - The date and time the HMI ID and version is confirmed by you
  - The Instructions (permissions and executions) to be carried out including any data debits (see below) as well as the list of data attributes requested through API calls
  - the HATDeX rating declared by the application at the point of exchange

4.2  It is not the responsibility of HATDeX to verify the HATDeX rating declared by the application. If you discover the rating declaration to be false, you should report it immediately so that the application can be investigated

4.3 When you confirm the HMI, details of the HMI will be logged by HATDeX as a confirmation ofthe exchange between you and the application.

## 5. Rules Applicable to Data Debits

5.1 DEFINITION. A Data Debit is the opening of a channel for the extraction of your data from your HAT Microserver through API access. You are able to share the data contained in your HAT Microserver when you confirm a set of HMIs. If you do so, a data debit channel will be created and named after the app of the data acquirer and our services will transfer the data to the destination you permit. A data debit is a contract that gives an application provider the license to use the set of data requested. We execute a transfer only upon theconfirmation of HMIs. Please think carefully about what you share because once it has been transferred you may no longer have control of the data. You are responsible for any data shared and are liable for any third-party data, including personal information of others, should you have them within your HAT.
