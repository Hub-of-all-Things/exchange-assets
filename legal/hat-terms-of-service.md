## 2. About HAT Microservers

A &quot; **HAT Microserver**&quot; is a personal microserver that can be used to collect, store and ultimately control your data (as a HAT &quot; **Owner**&quot;).  In using your HAT Microserver, you execute pieces of software code that are sets of permissions and instructions (&quot;the permissions&quot;) that would enable you to permit or instruct the collection of your data from multiple sources, the transformation and the transfer of the data from within your microserver. You can also also use the permissions to allow HATDeX Platform Services to view and easily manage your HAT.  You can also use a HAT Microserver as a type of universal user account to use the permissions to control other applications and services that are HAT enabled.

When operating your HAT Microserver you interact with the HATDeX Platform. In doing so, you must comply with the HAT Acceptable Use Policy ( https://hatdex.org/hat-acceptable-use-policy ).  HATDeX has no access to your data and are not responsible for its contents, organisation, visibility and usage. HATDeX services (such as the HAT app) may facilitate the convenient execution of your permissions.

### Security &amp; Usage of Your HAT Microserver

When you use the Services you may be required to provide information about yourself before you can continue to use the Services. This information that HATDeX collects from you to set up your HAT Microserver is your HATDeX account data (&quot; **Your HATDeX Account Data**&quot;).  Data in your HAT Microserver is your data (&quot; **Your Data**&quot;).  You agree to provide accurate, current and complete registration data and to update Your HATDeX Account Data as required in order to keep it accurate, current and complete.

We are a data controller and data processor for purposes of data protection law for Your HATDeX Account Data.  However, we are neither a data controller nor a data processor for purposes of data protection law for Your Data.  We simply enable you to claim, hold, and share Your Data by assisting you to easily execute the permissions in your HAT.

It is your responsibility to:

* a) protect against unauthorised access to your HAT Microserver
* b) not share, and otherwise ensure no-one else uses your HAT Microserver
* c) not use any account data or account of any other Owner or person than yourself without permission of the Owner or person holding the respective account
* d) keep your password or other access information secret (your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access), and
* e) generally maintain good internet security practices.

You will notify HATDeX immediately at support@hatdex.orgupon becoming aware of any unauthorised use of any of Your Data or Your HAT Microserver Data or any other breach of security.  If you think that your email account has been compromised you should change your HAT Microserver credentials, and in particular make sure your compromised email account does not allow access to your HAT Microserver.

### Data Plugs and Apps That Deposit Data Into Your HAT Microserver

A Data Plug is a third party service that may or may not be part of our Services.  It enables you to authorise the transfer of your data to and from a third party to your HAT Microserver.  You agree that you will only authorise a Data Plug when you are not prohibited under this Owner TOS or any applicable law from obtaining the data concerned.  We reserve the right not to execute the instruction or to disable any Data Plug for which you have not the right to obtain the data or that is in violation of the Terms of this Agreement or any applicable law.  You can decide to disable a Data Plug at any time.  The Data Plug will stop obtaining and transferring the data concerned as soon as you disable the Data Plug.  When you enable a data plug, you grant write access to the data plug to write data into your HAT Microserver.  We are not responsible for the accuracy of the data coming into the HAT through these data plugs.

If you authorise write access of your HAT Microserver to other apps, you grant permissions for the dedicated app namespace within your HAT Microserver to be activated, for the write access to be executed and for the app to write data into your HAT Microserver.  We are not responsible for the accuracy of data coming into the HAT through any write access, nor are we liable for its re-use and re-sharing. You agree that you will not amend any data within an app namespace through any other means except through the app that is authorised to write into the namespace.

## 3. Rules Applicable to HAT Owner Services

We make available to you various Owner Services (the &quot; **HAT Owner Services**&quot;), compatible with different computer Operating Systems, to enable you to manage the permissions within your HAT Microserver.  Some of the HAT Owner Services are also made available as an open source programme for others to build on.

Owner Services are web or mobile applications that allow the HAT Owner to view the data in their HAT Microserver and easily execute the permissions within the HAT.  Except for performance improvements, Owner Services do not store any HAT personal data.

HAT Owner Services extensions are additional software developed by us or third parties that can modify and/or enhance the functionality of the HAT Owner services (the &quot; **Extensions**&quot;).  Extensions may require the collection and processing of your personal and browsing data.  You agree that we may, without notice, look for available updates to Extensions, download them and install them automatically.  We reserve the right to disable or remove Extensions that do not comply with the Terms of this Agreement or any applicable law.

## 4. Rules Applicable to Data Debits

You are able to share the data contained in your HAT Microserver through a data debit permission.  You can create a data debit instruction to share your data with apps and websites which will instruct our Services to transfer the data to the destination you permit.  We execute a transfer only upon your instructions.  A Data Debit is an extraction of your data from your HAT Microserver.  Please think carefully about what you share because once it has been transferred you will no longer have control of the data.  You are responsible for any data shared and are liable for any third party data, including personal information of others, should you have them within your HAT.

For more information on Data Debits check https://developers.hubofallthings.com/guides/data-debits/.

### Data Acquirers and Data Offers

A **Data Acquirer** is a corporation, company, partnership, LLP or any other incorporated entity or sole trader acting in a business capacity.  Data Acquirers can make **Data Debit Requests** that set out the terms on which the Data Acquirer is willing to acquire access to Your Data in return for cash or other benefits.

When you agree to a Data Debit Request you expressly authorise us to execute the data transfer for which the request is made with the Data Acquirer issuing the Data Debit request.  We will only execute the transfer with the third party issuing the request.  We have no access to the content of the data being transferred.  When cash is being paid, we will credit the price paid by the Data Acquirer on your payment instrument within 5 working days from the date of acceptance (subject to any terms set by the Data Acquirer).

### Applications

We also make various applications (or &quot; **apps**&quot;) available on the HATDeX Platform.  Such applications are licensed and not sold to you and your licence to use the application will be dependent on your acceptance of additional terms (including in some instances payment terms) contained in an End User Licence Agreement that you will need to accept before using the application.

You are not permitted to remove, obscure, conceal, modify or otherwise alter any proprietary rights notices, signs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos or other marks of HATDeX, HATDeX&#39;s affiliates or any third party (including copyright and trade mark notices) which pertain to, are affixed to or which are contained within the Services and you agree not to use any such signs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos or other marks of HATDeX, HATDeX&#39;s affiliates or any third party in a way that is intended to, likely to or foreseeable to mislead others or cause confusion about the owner, license holder or authorised user, as the case may be, of such marks, names or logos.

## 8. Our Obligations &amp; Limitations on Liability

We will provide your HAT Microserver and the Services in accordance with this Owner TOS and all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, applicable privacy and data protection laws.  Except as set out in this Owner TOS and to the fullest extent permitted by law, we make no warranties, either express or implied, about the Services which is provided &#39;as is&#39;.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we or any the parties identified above shall not under this Owner TOS be liable for:

* b) any loss of profit or income
* c) any loss of business or business opportunity

* g) any loss of goodwill or reputation
* h) any other loss that could have been avoided by the damaged party&#39;s use of reasonable diligence.

We will not be in breach of this Owner TOS if the failure to perform any of our obligations is due to an event beyond our control, such as failure of part of the power grid, ISP equipment failure, host equipment failure, communications network failure, power failure, legal restrictions and censorship, failure of the Internet, natural disaster, war, riot, insurrection, epidemic, strikes, terrorism, or other events of a magnitude or type for which it is not possible for us to take precautions against.

If despite the exclusions and limitation above we are found liable by a court of law or regulatory authority for any loss or damage which arises out of or in connection in any way connected with our performance of this Owner TOS, then our maximum total aggregate liability will in no event exceed one month&#39;s subscription fee.

They will be marked as &#39;beta&#39;, &#39;preview&#39;, &#39;early access&#39;, &#39;evaluation&#39; or similar terms (&quot; **Test Services**&quot;).  You acknowledge that such Test Services may not be as reliable as other HAT services or features provided by us and subject to this Owner TOS.

## 10. Downloading or Using Software for Services

Some of our Services allow you to download and use client software (&quot; **Software**&quot;), which may be updated automatically.  As long as you comply with this Owner TOS you have a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the Software solely to access and use the Services and Platform.

To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source licence, we will make that licence available to you and the provisions of that licence may expressly override some of the terms of this Owner TOS.

* a) reverse engineer the Software
* b) decompile the Software
* c) use the Software for any purpose other than accessing or using the HATDeX Platform

## 11. We May Make Changes to the Terms

We may revise our Terms from time to time and will post the most current version on our website when the revised Terms become effective.

If there are any material changes to our Terms that affect your legal rights as an Owner of a HAT Microserver or user of DataBuyer, we will notify you by sending a message to the email address associated with your account at least 15 days before the changes take effect.

You accept the revised Terms by continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions come into effect.  In this case you are bound by and HATDeX will treat you as bound by the revised Terms from the date on which the revised Terms entered into effect.  You are free to end this Agreement at any time should you choose not to accept the revised Terms.


## 12. Changes to the HATDeX Platform and Services

We may update and change the HATDeX Platform from time to time to, amongst other things, reflect changes to our users&#39; needs and our business priorities.  We will try to give you reasonable notice of any major changes.

When you use the Services you will at all times observe these Terms and any applicable law or regulation in the relevant jurisdictions including the jurisdiction where you are a resident or from where you are using the Services.  HATDeX may at any time and in its sole discretion without prior warning or notice:

HATDeX will use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) ensure that the Services are available to you without undue disruption, interruption or delay, and (b) keep any disruption, interruption or delay of the Services to a minimum.

## 13. Maintenance &amp; Outages

We reserve the right to conduct activities necessary for the maintenance and support of the HATDeX Platform.  You agree to reasonably cooperate with us to investigate service outages or suspected breaches of the Terms or applicable laws.

HATDeX may automatically download and install updates from time to time (including firmware updates for the devices you registered with the Services) (&quot; **Software Updates**&quot;). Such Software Updates may be in various forms and are generally provided for the purposes of improving the performance, security and reliability of the Services or any product or device used to access the Services.  Such updates may include bug fixes, enhancements to the Services or parts thereof, products or devices and updates and enhancements to any software previously installed (including entirely new versions).

## 14. Suspension &amp; Termination

This Agreement remains in effect unless and until terminated either by you or HATDeX, as the case may be.  HATDeX may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing a 30 days prior written notice of cancellation to the email address provided to HATDeX as part of your registration for a HAT Owner Account or by any other suitable means which ensure that you will be able to take notice of the cancellation.

HATDeX is entitled to suspend access and use of your HAT Microserver and Services or terminate our agreement with you without observing any notice period if:

* a) you are in material breach of this Owner TOS
* b) you have clearly demonstrated (regardless of whether directly or through your actions or statements or otherwise) that you do not intend to comply with the Terms
* c) you fail to cooperate with our investigations relating to the provision of the HATDeX Platform
* d) necessary to prevent significant harm to the Platform or other users
* e) we are required by law or by a governmental authority to suspend access and/or use of the Platform.

If you received a free HAT Microserver we reserve the right to also terminate your account if you did not log into your HAT Microserver at least once a week after your first 90 days of Account opening.  We will provide you with reasonable notice if we suspend or terminate your access and/or use of the HATDeX Platform.

We may at our discretion decide to cease providing access to the Services in the jurisdiction where you reside, or from where you are attempting to access the HATDeX Platform.  In such an instance we will provide you with a prorated refund of any prepaid payments you have made for your HAT Microserver.

You may terminate your HAT Microserver by:

* a) sending notice in writing to contact@hatdex.org confirming such termination (please note it may take up to 14 days for us to action your request to terminate your account)
* b) clicking on the deactivation link in the HAT app and thereafter ceasing to use the Services (this feature is coming soon).

Whenever possible we will provide you with notice and a reasonable opportunity to export Your Data from your HAT Microserver.  Upon termination of this Owner TOS:

* a) the rights granted by us to you will cease immediately
* b) any provision of the Terms which expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination will survive.

Suspension or termination of this Agreement shall have no prejudice to any rights, obligations and liabilities that you or HATDeX have accrued or incurred during the term of this Agreement.

You are not permitted to use the Services if you do not accept the revised Terms or after this Agreement comes to an end, for example, due to termination by either you or HATDeX.

## 15. Age

If you are least 18 years old you can register for a HAT Microserver.  If you are under 18 a parent or guardian must sign on your behalf and the adult HAT will be linked to the minor&#39;s HAT.  Please note that not all HAT Providers are able to provide HATs for minors.  Please check that your HAT Provider has that provision before you sign up a minor for a HAT, or if you are below 18 years old.

## 16. Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment

If we fail or delay to enforce a provision of the Terms this failure or delay is not a waiver of our right to do so later on.  If a provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable by a court, such provision shall be modified and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law.  The remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.  You may not transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any of your rights or obligations under this Owner TOS whether by operation of law or otherwise, and any such attempt will be null and void.  We may transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any of our rights and obligations under this Owner TOS without your consent.  We may also assign this Agreement in its entirety, without your consent, to our successor in interest in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all assets or equity.  This Owner TOS shall bind and inure to our benefit, our successors and permitted assigns.

## 17. Entire Agreement &amp; Third Parties

This Owner TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and us when it comes to the subject matter of this Owner TOS and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Owner TOS.


## 18. Dispute Resolution

Our approach is to resolve any disputes between us without going to court and you agree that in the case of any disputes we will resolve such a dispute using the following escalation process.  If you only wish to raise a complaint then please contact us at contact@hatdex.org.

**Step 1:** You contact us at info@hatdex.orgor we contact you using the email address that you selected when registering for a HAT Microserver.  The purpose of the notice is to let each other know of the dispute and provide information as to what it is about.  We or you will acknowledge receipt of such notice as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no more than 7 days from the day that the notice is received (&quot; **Notification Date**&quot;).

**Step 2:** We discuss together and make all reasonable efforts to try and resolve the dispute between us.

**Step 3:** You can write to HAT Community Foundation (the &quot; **Regulator**&quot;) which is the regulator of the HATDeX Platform at the following email address: contact@hatcommunity.org.
